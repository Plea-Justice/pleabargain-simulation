# Plea Bargain Simulation
The Plea Justice Project offers research and law professionals an immersive simulation of plea bargaining processes for use in studies and in education. This animated software was created as an alternative to existing research paradigms (i.e. vignettes and high-stakes deceptions) used to study plea decision-making.

This repository contains the plea bargaining simulation code, ready to deploy to any web server. A project overview and detailed documentation are available at [pleajustice.org](https://pleajustice.org).
